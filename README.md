# Dev Progress Log – May 2025

This repository documents my ongoing growth in software development and technical writing.

## What I'm Working On

- Sharpening frontend fundamentals through the ALX ProDev track  
- Advancing technical writing via the TechWriting program from TechCrush  
- Committing daily to maintain discipline and momentum  
- Building real-world projects that solve problems and demonstrate practical skills  

## Goals

- Build and push 3 solid real-world frontend projects this month (React + JS)
- Publish 2–3 technical blog posts (dev concepts, tutorials, breakdowns)
- Land paid opportunities or internships as soon as possible
